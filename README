Operating System Simulator - Memory Management

To run program: 
1. make
2. 
- ./oss		Run with default arguments. 
- ./oss -h	Display help message for usage. 
- ./oss -s x	Run while specificying a max number of x current processes. 

Known issues: 
- Code straight up does not run like I want it to. I've rewritten it like three times. 
Something is messing it up right when it runs into the main loop portion. I 
commented the code really well to show that I understand the logic of the paging and 
second change algorithm, but I cannot figure out the issue. 

Things it does: 
- Sets up shared memory for system clock
- Uses message queues
- Uses getotps
- Destroys shared memory and message queue upon termination (early or normal)
- Used signal handling 
- Sets up a process control block and frame table

Please see comments throughout code to see the logic of it all. 

I can't figure out what is blocking it frrom working correctly. 

Sanjiv's Notes...
– Second-Chance Algorithm
	∗ Basically a FIFO replacement algorithm
	∗ When a page is selected, examine its reference bit
	∗ If reference bit is 0, replace the page
	∗ If reference bit is 1, give the page a second chance and proceed to select the next FIFO page
	∗ To give second chance, reset the reference bit and set the page arrival time to current time
	∗ A frequently used page is always kept in memory
	∗ Commonly implemented by a circular queue
	∗ Worst case when all bits are set (degenerates to FIFO replacement)
	∗ Performance evaluation with reference string 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2 the reference bit as -1 or -0 at each time
		instance.
