Sanjiv's Notes...
– Second-Chance Algorithm
	∗ Basically a FIFO replacement algorithm
	∗ When a page is selected, examine its reference bit
	∗ If reference bit is 0, replace the page
	∗ If reference bit is 1, give the page a second chance and proceed to select the next FIFO page
	∗ To give second chance, reset the reference bit and set the page arrival time to current time
	∗ A frequently used page is always kept in memory
	∗ Commonly implemented by a circular queue
	∗ Worst case when all bits are set (degenerates to FIFO replacement)
	∗ Performance evaluation with reference string 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2 the reference bit as -1 or -0 at each time
